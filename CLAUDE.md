# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Camp Explorer Europe 2026 is a sophisticated React-based web application showcasing 106 verified European summer camps across 12 countries including premium Scandinavian programs. It features advanced search/filtering, comprehensive camp data, and modern responsive design optimized for camp discovery and selection.

## Core Architecture

- **Framework**: React 18 + Vite (single-page application)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components and shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect) - no external state library
- **Main Data**: All camp data is embedded in `src/App.jsx` as a JavaScript array (`allCamps`)
- **Component Structure**: Monolithic component in `App.jsx` with shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/`

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server on http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # Production build to dist/
npm run preview      # Preview production build locally
npm run lint         # Run ESLint (important - always run before commits)

# No test suite currently configured
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Camp Data Structure
- Located in `src/App.jsx` starting around line 23
- Each camp object includes: id, name, location, country, ages, price, category, activities, languages, highlights
- 8 camp categories: premium, academic, language, sports, family, budget, unique
- Price ranges from ‚Ç¨330 to CHF 6,980

### Search & Filtering System
- Real-time search across camp names, locations, countries (searchTerm state)
- Category filtering with dynamic result counts (selectedFilter state)  
- Country-based filtering (selectedCountry state)
- Combined search + filter logic in filtering functions

### Component Architecture
- Single large component in `App.jsx` (~2850+ lines)
- Uses shadcn/ui components extensively (Button, Card, Badge, etc.)
- Path alias configured: `@/` maps to `./src/`
- Images stored in `src/assets/` and imported directly

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS with custom utilities in `src/App.css`
- Responsive design: mobile-first with tablet/desktop breakpoints
- Color-coded camp categories with custom CSS classes
- Heavy use of Tailwind utility classes throughout JSX

## Build Configuration

- **Vite config**: Optimized bundle splitting for React/React-DOM and Lucide icons
- **ESLint**: Configured for React with hooks and refresh plugins
- **Tailwind**: Basic setup scanning all JS/JSX files
- **Deployment**: Configured for Vercel with proper base path and asset handling

## Development Guidelines

- Follow existing patterns when adding new camps to `allCamps` array
- Maintain consistent data structure for camp objects
- Use existing shadcn/ui components before creating custom ones
- Stick to inline Tailwind classes matching existing style patterns
- Test search/filter functionality thoroughly when modifying camp data
- Always run `npm run lint` before making commits

## File Organization

```

## Project Context & Business Strategy

### ResourceHub Overview
This site is part of **ResourceHub** - an umbrella project for building authoritative niche informational websites. Other sites include Pinworm Guide (completed). All sites follow the same strategy: become the #1 Google resource for their specific topic through comprehensive content and enterprise-level SEO.

### Business Model & Goals
- **Target Audience**: Parents seeking European summer camps for children/youth (up to 24 years, preferably younger)
- **Primary Goal**: Become the definitive one-stop resource for European summer camps for kids and youth
- **Monetization Strategy**: Generate traffic to eventually monetize through data sales, site sales, or premium camp listing fees
- **User Journey**: Comprehensive information ‚Üí direct links to camp websites (no booking handling)

### Content Strategy & Quality Standards
- **Camp Selection Criteria**: Price ranges, age groups, activities, accreditation, location, themes (academic, sports, etc.)
- **Verification Process**: Extensive internet research using camp websites, review sites, 3rd party sources, and AI cross-referencing
- **Quality Assurance**: Must verify camps are real, relevant, with accurate data, pricing, and working website links
- **Camp Types**: Both smaller local camps and larger international camps, all serving kids/youth demographic

### SEO & Growth Strategy
- **Enterprise-level SEO**: Every element optimized for search terms parents would use
- **File Naming**: All files and URLs must follow SEO best practices  
- **Content-First Approach**: Build comprehensive guides before websites, covering topics not found elsewhere
- **Traffic Goal**: Become #1 Google result for European summer camp searches

### Technical Deployment Workflow
- **Primary Workflow**: Claude Code automated commits ‚Üí User push to origin ‚Üí Vercel deployment
- **Development Process**: Local changes ‚Üí Claude Code commits with comprehensive summaries ‚Üí User push in GitHub Desktop ‚Üí Automatic Vercel deployment  
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub (PixelSnack), Vercel deployment, CloudFlare domains
- **Important**: Claude Code handles full commit process including staging, commit messages, and comprehensive summaries
- **User Role**: Only needs to "Push to origin" in GitHub Desktop after Claude Code completes commits
- **Tools Available**: GitHub CLI and Vercel CLI configured in Claude Code environment

### Recent Technical Updates (September 8, 2025)

#### ‚úÖ PHASE 1 OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE
- **Security Headers Enhanced**: Added HSTS and CSP headers for enterprise-level security
- **Sitemap Cleaned & Optimized**: Reduced from 22 problematic hash fragment URLs to 1 clean URL with optimized 127KB WebP image reference
- **Complete Accessibility Compliance**: Fixed all button aria-labels and footer keyboard navigation (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- **Critical Filter UX Bug Fixed**: "All Camps" button now properly resets country filters after footer navigation

#### üöÄ MAJOR PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
- **Hero Image Optimized**: 92% size reduction (1,674KB ‚Üí 127KB WebP, 169KB AVIF, 677KB PNG)
- **Picture Element Implementation**: Modern responsive images with progressive enhancement
- **Expected LCP Improvement**: 85-92% faster hero image loading
- **Mobile Performance**: Dramatic improvement on slower connections

#### üîß Previous Updates (Earlier September 2025)
- **Google Search Console Issues Fixed**: Resolved all critical structured data errors
- **404 Errors Resolved**: Removed invalid hreflang references
- **Social Media Meta Tags Updated**: Corrected og:image and twitter:image references
- **JSON-LD Structured Data**: Fixed parsing errors and validation issues

### CRITICAL SEO ARCHITECTURE ISSUES IDENTIFIED (September 2025)
**Major Discovery**: Comprehensive code audit revealed excellent implementation quality BUT critical SPA indexing limitations:

1. **Single-Page Architecture Problem**: Google can only index homepage (1 of 22 sitemap URLs). Hash-based navigation (#discover, #guide, etc.) cannot be crawled as separate pages.

2. **Sitemap Contains Fake URLs**: Current sitemap lists 22 URLs with hash fragments that don't exist as server-rendered pages:
   - `/#discover`, `/#guide`, `/#resources?section=booking-timeline`
   - `/#discover?country=Switzerland` etc.
   - Google marks these as "Discovered - not indexed"

3. **Schema.org Product Misuse**: Using Product/Offer schema for camps in index.html is incorrect - camps aren't e-commerce products. Should use Organization/EducationalOrganization.

### IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Approved September 2025)

**PHASE 1 (Week 1) - ZERO RISK QUICK WINS:**
- Add security headers to `public/_headers` (HSTS, CSP, nosniff, frame-options)
- Clean sitemap to only real URLs, resubmit to GSC
- Fix accessibility: "View Details & Book" needs unique aria-labels (App.jsx:1097)
- Fix footer filters: Convert `<li onClick>` to `<button>` for keyboard access (App.jsx:2591-2598)
- Hero image: Convert CSS background to `<img>` with `fetchpriority="high"`

**PHASE 2 (Weeks 2-4) - ARCHITECTURE UPGRADE:**
- Implement React Router alongside existing hash navigation
- Create real routes: `/guide`, `/discover/switzerland`, `/category/premium`
- Extract components while preserving all existing functionality
- Add static generation (Next.js integration or Vite SSG)

**PHASE 3 (Weeks 5-8) - SEO OPTIMIZATION:**
- Generate dedicated country/category pages with unique content
- Replace Product schema with proper Organization schema
- Add About/Privacy pages for E-E-A-T
- Implement proper structured data per page type

### Code Quality Assessment (September 2025)
**REALITY CHECK**: After reading entire 2,675-line codebase systematically:

**‚úÖ ALREADY EXCELLENT:**
- Accessibility: Skip links, ARIA labels, touch targets, descriptive alt text
- Performance: Lazy loading, proper image handling, mobile-first CSS
- Security: Most headers configured, strategic robots.txt  
- Code quality: Well-structured components, clean data model
- UX: Advanced filtering, comparison tools, comprehensive content

**‚ùå ONLY 3 CRITICAL ISSUES:**
1. Footer accessibility (keyboard navigation)
2. Repeated button text (screen reader issue)  
3. Missing HSTS header

**Audit Accuracy**: PDF audit claims were 70% inaccurate/exaggerated. HTML audit was much more accurate.

## SEO & Technical Health Status

### Search Engine Optimization (Completed Sept 8, 2025)
- **‚úÖ Sitemap**: Clean single-URL structure with optimized 127KB WebP image reference
- **‚úÖ Security Headers**: Enterprise-grade HSTS and CSP implementation
- **üîÑ Structured Data**: Clean on homepage (Product schema correction pending Phase 2)
- **‚úÖ Open Graph Tags**: Properly configured with correct hero image references
- **‚úÖ Meta Tags**: Complete title, description, keywords, and social media optimization
- **‚úÖ Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved across entire site
- **üéØ Ready for Resubmission**: Google Search Console sitemap ready for improved indexation

### Current Hero Images (Optimized September 8, 2025)
- **AVIF**: `hero-lakeside.avif` (169KB - best quality, modern browsers)
- **WebP**: `hero-lakeside.webp` (127KB - excellent compatibility) 
- **PNG**: `hero-lakeside-compressed.png` (677KB - universal fallback)
- **Location**: `src/assets/` (bundled) + `public/european-summer-camps-lakeside-hero.webp` (sitemap)
- **Implementation**: Picture element with progressive enhancement in App.jsx
- **Original**: `european-summer-camps-lakeside-hero.png` (1.67MB - maintained for camp data)

## Important Notes

- Camp data is hardcoded in JavaScript - no external API or CMS
- No backend or database - purely static frontend application
- Images are imported and bundled with Vite
- Responsive design heavily tested across device sizes
- SEO and performance optimized for camp discovery use case
- All development decisions should prioritize SEO, user experience, and content quality
- Always verify social media meta tags match current assets when making image updates

## ResourceHub Universal Lessons Learned

Based on the Camp Explorer Europe 2026 project development, here are 10 key universal principles for building successful ResourceHub niche authority websites:

### Technical Foundation
1. **Structured Data Excellence**: Complete JSON-LD schema with all required properties (images, pricing, merchant policies). Missing properties cause Search Console errors that directly impact rankings.

2. **Social Media Meta Synchronization**: og:image and twitter:image must stay synchronized with actual hero images. Mismatched references create confusing user experiences in social shares.

3. **Strategic Robots.txt Configuration**: Allow beneficial AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, FacebookBot) for discoverability. Block data scrapers (CCBot, Google-Extended) but allow SEO tools (Ahrefs, Semrush). Align blocking strategy with business goals, not generic security advice.

### SEO Architecture  
4. **Clean URL Structure**: Never reference non-existent pages in hreflang tags or sitemaps. Invalid language directories create 404 crawler errors that harm SEO health.

5. **Proactive Sitemap Maintenance**: Update lastmod dates after significant changes, include proper image references, and resubmit to search engines to accelerate re-crawling and indexing.

### Content Strategy
6. **Comprehensive Data Over Surface Content**: 100+ verified entries with detailed information (pricing, specifications, unique features) outperforms thin directory listings. Quality verification builds authority and user trust.

### User Experience
7. **Advanced Search/Filter Systems**: Real-time search across multiple fields with category filtering and dynamic result counts. Combined search + filter logic must work reliably across all use cases.

8. **Mobile-First Performance**: Most niche resource discovery happens on mobile. Responsive design and performance optimization for mobile networks is mandatory, not optional.

### Business Intelligence
9. **Search Console Monitoring**: Google Console issues directly impact rankings. Fix structured data errors immediately as they compound over time. Weekly audits prevent small issues becoming major problems.

10. **Technical Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation (like this CLAUDE.md) covering current technical state, hero image filenames, SEO status, and resolved issues to prevent regression.

### ResourceHub Implementation Framework
For each new niche site: Start with comprehensive data collection ‚Üí Implement complete structured data ‚Üí Set up consistent social media meta tags ‚Üí Configure strategic robots.txt ‚Üí Create detailed sitemaps ‚Üí Monitor Search Console weekly ‚Üí Document all technical decisions.

**Success Metrics**: Zero critical Search Console errors, complete structured data validation, consistent social media previews, growing organic traffic from target keywords, AI assistant accessibility for user queries.
