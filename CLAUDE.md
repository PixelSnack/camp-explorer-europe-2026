# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Camp Explorer Europe 2026 is a sophisticated React-based web application showcasing 106 verified European summer camps across 12 countries including premium Scandinavian programs. It features advanced search/filtering, comprehensive camp data, and modern responsive design optimized for camp discovery and selection.

## Core Architecture

- **Framework**: React 18 + Vite (single-page application)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components and shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect) - no external state library
- **Main Data**: All camp data is embedded in `src/App.jsx` as a JavaScript array (`allCamps`)
- **Component Structure**: Monolithic component in `App.jsx` with shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/`

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server on http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # Production build to dist/
npm run preview      # Preview production build locally
npm run lint         # Run ESLint (important - always run before commits)

# No test suite currently configured
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Camp Data Structure
- Located in `src/App.jsx` starting around line 23
- Each camp object includes: id, name, location, country, ages, price, category, activities, languages, highlights
- 8 camp categories: premium, academic, language, sports, family, budget, unique
- Price ranges from €330 to CHF 6,980

### Camp Categories (Optimized for User Expectations)
- **Premium Alpine (2)** - Swiss luxury mountain experiences
- **Academic & STEM (6)** - University prep, intensive learning programs  
- **Language Immersion (2)** - Spanish/French intensive programs
- **Sports Specialty (3)** - Football academies, Olympic training, adventure sports
- **Family Programs (3)** - Multi-age welcome, family-friendly activities
- **Budget Excellence (2)** - Quality programs under €2,000
- **Outdoor Adventures (4)** - Nature-based, unique outdoor experiences
- **Category Logic**: Single categories only (no multi-tagging) for optimal UX and SEO positioning

### IMPORTANT: Camp Count Distinction (For SEO)
- **22 Organizations**: Camp organizations/sites in our database 
- **100+ Camps**: Total individual camp programs offered by all organizations
- **SEO Requirement**: Always use "100+ camps" in marketing copy, not "22"
- **Rationale**: Organizations like Piispala offer "300+ camps annually", Metsäkartano "100+ groups annually"
- **Rule**: Only reference "22" when specifically talking about organizations, never for SEO copy

### Search & Filtering System
- Real-time search across camp names, locations, countries (searchTerm state)
- Category filtering with dynamic result counts (selectedFilter state)  
- Country-based filtering (selectedCountry state)
- Combined search + filter logic in filtering functions

### Component Architecture
- Single large component in `App.jsx` (~2850+ lines)
- Uses shadcn/ui components extensively (Button, Card, Badge, etc.)
- Path alias configured: `@/` maps to `./src/`
- Images stored in `src/assets/` and imported directly

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS with custom utilities in `src/App.css`
- Responsive design: mobile-first with tablet/desktop breakpoints
- Color-coded camp categories with custom CSS classes
- Heavy use of Tailwind utility classes throughout JSX

## Build Configuration

- **Vite config**: Optimized bundle splitting for React/React-DOM and Lucide icons
- **ESLint**: Configured for React with hooks and refresh plugins
- **Tailwind**: Basic setup scanning all JS/JSX files
- **Deployment**: Configured for Vercel with proper base path and asset handling

## Development Guidelines

- Follow existing patterns when adding new camps to `allCamps` array
- Maintain consistent data structure for camp objects
- Use existing shadcn/ui components before creating custom ones
- Stick to inline Tailwind classes matching existing style patterns
- Test search/filter functionality thoroughly when modifying camp data
- Always run `npm run lint` before making commits

## File Organization

```

## Project Context & Business Strategy

### ResourceHub Overview
This site is part of **ResourceHub** - an umbrella project for building authoritative niche informational websites. Other sites include Pinworm Guide (completed). All sites follow the same strategy: become the #1 Google resource for their specific topic through comprehensive content and enterprise-level SEO.

### Business Model & Goals
- **Target Audience**: Parents seeking European summer camps for children/youth (up to 24 years, preferably younger)
- **Primary Goal**: Become the definitive one-stop resource for European summer camps for kids and youth
- **Monetization Strategy**: Generate traffic to eventually monetize through data sales, site sales, or premium camp listing fees
- **User Journey**: Comprehensive information → direct links to camp websites (no booking handling)

### Content Strategy & Quality Standards
- **Camp Selection Criteria**: Price ranges, age groups, activities, accreditation, location, themes (academic, sports, etc.)
- **Verification Process**: Extensive internet research using camp websites, review sites, 3rd party sources, and AI cross-referencing
- **Quality Assurance**: Must verify camps are real, relevant, with accurate data, pricing, and working website links
- **Camp Types**: Both smaller local camps and larger international camps, all serving kids/youth demographic

### SEO & Growth Strategy
- **Enterprise-level SEO**: Every element optimized for search terms parents would use
- **File Naming**: All files and URLs must follow SEO best practices  
- **Content-First Approach**: Build comprehensive guides before websites, covering topics not found elsewhere
- **Traffic Goal**: Become #1 Google result for European summer camp searches

### Technical Deployment Workflow
- **Primary Workflow**: Claude Code automated commits → User push to origin → Vercel deployment
- **Development Process**: Local changes → Claude Code commits with comprehensive summaries → User push in GitHub Desktop → Automatic Vercel deployment  
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub (PixelSnack), Vercel deployment, CloudFlare domains
- **Important**: Claude Code handles full commit process including staging, commit messages, and comprehensive summaries
- **User Role**: Only needs to "Push to origin" in GitHub Desktop after Claude Code completes commits
- **Tools Available**: GitHub CLI and Vercel CLI configured in Claude Code environment

### Recent Technical Updates (September 8, 2025)

#### ✅ PHASE 1 OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE
- **Security Headers Enhanced**: Added HSTS and CSP headers for enterprise-level security
- **Sitemap Cleaned & Optimized**: Reduced from 22 problematic hash fragment URLs to 1 clean URL with optimized 127KB WebP image reference
- **Complete Accessibility Compliance**: Fixed all button aria-labels and footer keyboard navigation (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- **Critical Filter UX Bug Fixed**: "All Camps" button now properly resets country filters after footer navigation

#### 🚀 COMPREHENSIVE PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
- **ALL Images Optimized**: Complete site-wide image optimization (September 13, 2025)
- **Hero Image**: 92% reduction (1,674KB → 127KB WebP, 169KB AVIF, 677KB PNG)
- **Activities Collage**: 93% reduction (1,966KB → 132KB WebP, 275KB AVIF, 285KB PNG)

- **404 Errors Resolved**: Removed invalid hreflang references
- **Social Media Meta Tags Updated**: Corrected og:image and twitter:image references
- **JSON-LD Structured Data**: Fixed parsing errors and validation issues

### CRITICAL SEO ARCHITECTURE ISSUES IDENTIFIED (September 2025)
**Major Discovery**: Comprehensive code audit revealed excellent implementation quality BUT critical SPA indexing limitations:

1. **Single-Page Architecture Problem**: Google can only index homepage (1 of 22 sitemap URLs). Hash-based navigation (#discover, #guide, etc.) cannot be crawled as separate pages.

2. **Sitemap Contains Fake URLs**: Current sitemap lists 22 URLs with hash fragments that don't exist as server-rendered pages:
   - `/#discover`, `/#guide`, `/#resources?section=booking-timeline`
   - `/#discover?country=Switzerland` etc.
   - Google marks these as "Discovered - not indexed"

3. **Schema.org Compliance**: ✅ FIXED - Replaced Product/Offer schema with proper Event schema for camps and ListItem for categories (Phase 1.7 complete)

### IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Approved September 2025)

**PHASE 1 (Week 1) - ZERO RISK QUICK WINS:**
- Add security headers to `public/_headers` (HSTS, CSP, nosniff, frame-options)
- Clean sitemap to only real URLs, resubmit to GSC
- Fix accessibility: "View Details & Book" needs unique aria-labels (App.jsx:1097)
- Fix footer filters: Convert `<li onClick>` to `<button>` for keyboard access (App.jsx:2591-2598)
- Hero image: Convert CSS background to `<img>` with `fetchpriority="high"`

**PHASE 2 (Weeks 2-4) - ARCHITECTURE UPGRADE:**
- Implement React Router alongside existing hash navigation
- Create real routes: `/guide`, `/discover/switzerland`, `/category/premium`
- Extract components while preserving all existing functionality
- Add static generation (Next.js integration or Vite SSG)

**PHASE 3 (Weeks 5-8) - SEO OPTIMIZATION:**
- Generate dedicated country/category pages with unique content
- Replace Product schema with proper Organization schema
- Add About/Privacy pages for E-E-A-T
- Implement proper structured data per page type

### Code Quality Assessment (September 2025)
**REALITY CHECK**: After reading entire 2,675-line codebase systematically:

**✅ ALREADY EXCELLENT:**
- Accessibility: Skip links, ARIA labels, touch targets, descriptive alt text
- Performance: Lazy loading, proper image handling, mobile-first CSS
- Security: Most headers configured, strategic robots.txt  
- Code quality: Well-structured components, clean data model
- UX: Advanced filtering, comparison tools, comprehensive content

**❌ ONLY 3 CRITICAL ISSUES:**
1. Footer accessibility (keyboard navigation)
2. Repeated button text (screen reader issue)  
3. Missing HSTS header

**Audit Accuracy**: PDF audit claims were 70% inaccurate/exaggerated. HTML audit was much more accurate.

## SEO & Technical Health Status

### Search Engine Optimization (Completed Sept 8, 2025)
- **✅ Sitemap**: Clean single-URL structure with optimized 127KB WebP image reference
- **✅ Security Headers**: Enterprise-grade HSTS and CSP implementation
- **✅ Structured Data**: Event and ListItem schema properly implemented for directory portal compliance
- **✅ Open Graph Tags**: Properly configured with correct hero image references
- **✅ Meta Tags**: Complete title, description, keywords, and social media optimization
- **✅ Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved across entire site
- **🎯 Ready for Resubmission**: Google Search Console sitemap ready for improved indexation

### Current Hero Images (Optimized September 8, 2025)
- **AVIF**: `hero-lakeside.avif` (169KB - best quality, modern browsers)
- **WebP**: `hero-lakeside.webp` (127KB - excellent compatibility) 
- **PNG**: `hero-lakeside-compressed.png` (677KB - universal fallback)
- **Location**: `src/assets/` (bundled) + `public/european-summer-camps-lakeside-hero.webp` (sitemap)
- **Implementation**: Picture element with progressive enhancement in App.jsx
- **Original**: `european-summer-camps-lakeside-hero.png` (1.67MB - maintained for camp data)

## Important Notes

- Camp data is hardcoded in JavaScript - no external API or CMS
- No backend or database - purely static frontend application
- Images are imported and bundled with Vite
- Responsive design heavily tested across device sizes
- SEO and performance optimized for camp discovery use case
- All development decisions should prioritize SEO, user experience, and content quality
- Always verify social media meta tags match current assets when making image updates

## ResourceHub Universal Lessons Learned

Based on the Camp Explorer Europe 2026 project development, here are 10 key universal principles for building successful ResourceHub niche authority websites:

### Technical Foundation
1. **Structured Data Excellence**: Complete JSON-LD schema with all required properties (images, pricing, merchant policies). Missing properties cause Search Console errors that directly impact rankings.

2. **Social Media Meta Synchronization**: og:image and twitter:image must stay synchronized with actual hero images. Mismatched references create confusing user experiences in social shares.

3. **Strategic Robots.txt Configuration**: Allow beneficial AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, FacebookBot) for discoverability. Block data scrapers (CCBot, Google-Extended) but allow SEO tools (Ahrefs, Semrush). Align blocking strategy with business goals, not generic security advice.

### SEO Architecture  
4. **Clean URL Structure**: Never reference non-existent pages in hreflang tags or sitemaps. Invalid language directories create 404 crawler errors that harm SEO health.

5. **Proactive Sitemap Maintenance**: Update lastmod dates after significant changes, include proper image references, and resubmit to search engines to accelerate re-crawling and indexing.

### Content Strategy
6. **Comprehensive Data Over Surface Content**: 100+ verified entries with detailed information (pricing, specifications, unique features) outperforms thin directory listings. Quality verification builds authority and user trust.

### User Experience
7. **Advanced Search/Filter Systems**: Real-time search across multiple fields with category filtering and dynamic result counts. Combined search + filter logic must work reliably across all use cases.

8. **Mobile-First Performance**: Most niche resource discovery happens on mobile. Responsive design and performance optimization for mobile networks is mandatory, not optional.

### Business Intelligence
9. **Search Console Monitoring**: Google Console issues directly impact rankings. Fix structured data errors immediately as they compound over time. Weekly audits prevent small issues becoming major problems.

10. **Technical Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation (like this CLAUDE.md) covering current technical state, hero image filenames, SEO status, and resolved issues to prevent regression.

### ResourceHub Implementation Framework
For each new niche site: Start with comprehensive data collection → Implement complete structured data → Set up consistent social media meta tags → Configure strategic robots.txt → Create detailed sitemaps → Monitor Search Console weekly → Document all technical decisions.

**Success Metrics**: Zero critical Search Console errors, complete structured data validation, consistent social media previews, growing organic traffic from target keywords, AI assistant accessibility for user queries.

npm run lint     # Should pass (6 safe shadcn warnings OK)
npm run dev      # Should start on http://localhost:5173
```

### **Step 4: Understand Current Priorities**
- **Phase 2 Readiness**: Waiting for 1,000+ monthly sessions
- **Current Focus**: Content expansion, SEO optimization, business growth
- **Technical Debt**: Minimal - excellent code quality maintained
- **⚠️ DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW**: Claude Code automates commits with comprehensive summaries - user only pushes to origin

### **Step 5: Follow Development Guidelines**
- **🚨 MANDATORY HOLISTIC REVIEW**: EVERY change must pass 7-dimension check (see DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md Rule #0)
- **Zero-Breakage Principle**: Never break existing functionality
- **SEO-First Mindset**: Every change should support #1 Google ranking goal  
- **Enterprise Quality**: Maintain performance, accessibility, security standards
- **Testing Protocol**: Build + Lint + Manual verification required
- **🚨 MANDATORY COMMIT PROCESS**: After ANY code changes, immediately run `git add` + `git commit` with comprehensive message - user only pushes to origin

### **⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER: ALWAYS COMMIT CHANGES**
**🔥 NEVER FORGET: After making code changes and testing, you MUST commit immediately before announcing completion**

### **⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER: NO TUNNEL VISION**
**Before ANY code change, ask yourself:**
1. Performance impact? 2. SEO compliance? 3. Business alignment? 
4. Accessibility maintained? 5. Security preserved? 6. Mobile UX?
7. Documentation accuracy?

**If you can't answer ALL 7: STOP and reassess holistically.**
