## ✅ Issues Fixed

### January 14, 2026

#### 1. glob CLI Command Injection (HIGH → FIXED)
- **CVE:** GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Location:** node_modules/sucrase/node_modules/glob
- **Risk:** Command injection via -c/--cmd with shell:true
- **Resolution:** `npm audit fix` - upgraded glob package
- **Impact on site:** None (development dependency only)

#### 2. js-yaml Prototype Pollution (MODERATE → FIXED)
- **CVE:** GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m
- **Severity:** MODERATE
- **Location:** node_modules/js-yaml
- **Risk:** Prototype pollution in merge (<<) operator
- **Resolution:** `npm audit fix` - upgraded js-yaml package
- **Impact on site:** None

---

## ⏸️ Issues Deferred (Acceptable Risk)

### esbuild Development Server Vulnerability (MODERATE)
- **CVE:** GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
- **Severity:** MODERATE
- **Location:** node_modules/esbuild
- **Risk:** Dev server request vulnerability
- **Why Deferred:**
  - Only affects LOCAL development server, not production
  - Fix requires Vite 7.x upgrade (breaking changes)
  - Production site is not affected
- **Review Date:** April 2026 (check if Vite 7.x is stable)

### vite Dependency on esbuild (MODERATE)
- **CVE:** Same as above (depends on vulnerable esbuild)
- **Severity:** MODERATE
- **Why Deferred:** Same as esbuild - development only
- **Review Date:** April 2026

## 🛡️ Security Strengths Confirmed

### Enterprise Security Headers ✅
**Location:** `public/_headers`
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
Content-Security-Policy: [properly configured]
```
**Assessment:** Excellent - enterprise-grade protection

### XSS Prevention ✅
- React's automatic JSX escaping
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user input
- Controlled components for all forms
- Search/filter uses safe string matching

### GDPR Compliance ✅
- Cookie consent banner with accept/reject
- Analytics blocked until explicit consent
- Privacy policy accessible
- LocalStorage consent management

### Content Security Policy ✅
- Scripts restricted to known trusted sources
- Only necessary external connections allowed
- iframe embedding prevented
- Appropriate exceptions for React/Tailwind

### Data Protection ✅
- No sensitive data in codebase
- No database credentials
- No private API keys
- All camp data is public information

## 📋 Recommended Actions (Non-Urgent)

### EmailJS Dashboard Configuration
**Status:** PENDING (User Action Required)
**Risk:** Low
**Effort:** 5 minutes

**Actions to take in EmailJS Dashboard:**
1. **Enable Rate Limiting:** Prevent potential spam/abuse
2. **Domain Restrictions:** Only accept requests from europeansummercamps.com
3. **Monitor Usage:** Check dashboard periodically for unusual activity

**How to access:** https://dashboard.emailjs.com → Select your service → Settings

---

### Google Analytics 4 Configuration
**Status:** OPTIONAL
**Current State:** Placeholder ID (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`) in code

If analytics tracking is desired:
1. Create GA4 property in Google Analytics
2. Get Measurement ID (format: `G-XXXXXXXX`)
3. Replace placeholder in `src/App.jsx` line 8

**Note:** The code already handles the placeholder correctly - analytics won't load until a real ID is provided.

## 🚫 Do Not Change (Working & Secure)

These items were reviewed and confirmed as properly implemented:

| Item | Location | Reason to Leave Alone |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| Contact form validation | App.jsx | HTML5 + EmailJS sanitization sufficient |
| X-XSS-Protection header | _headers | Deprecated but harmless; CSP is primary protection |
| External link handling | App.jsx | Modern browsers auto-apply noopener |
| LocalStorage consent | App.jsx | Correct GDPR implementation |
| shadcn/ui components | components/ui/ | Third-party code; don't modify |

## 📅 Security Review Schedule

| Review Type | Frequency | Next Due |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Dependency Audit (`npm audit`) | Monthly | February 14, 2026 |
| Full Security Audit | Quarterly | April 2026 |
| Vite 7.x Upgrade Assessment | When stable | April 2026 |
| GDPR Compliance Check | Annually | January 2027 |

## 💡 Future Security Considerations

### When Traffic Increases (1K+ sessions/month)
- Consider Web Application Firewall (WAF) via Cloudflare
- Implement rate limiting on contact form submissions
- Add honeypot fields to contact form for bot detection

### When Adding User Accounts (Future Phase)
- Implement proper authentication (OAuth recommended)
- Add CSRF protection
- Consider session management security
- Review data encryption requirements

### When Adding Payment Processing (Future Monetization)
- PCI DSS compliance assessment required
- Use established payment providers (Stripe, PayPal)
- Never store payment card data
- Additional security audit recommended

### When Upgrading to Vite 7.x
- Full regression testing required
- Review breaking changes documentation
- Test in staging environment first
- Update this document with new audit
