### Expansion Execution Process

**For Each New Camp:**

1. **Research Phase** (use `camp-content-researcher` agent)
   ```
   "Find 2-3 quality summer camps in [COUNTRY]:
   - Focus: [specific region or type]
   - Must be: Residential camps (not tour operators)
   - Verify: Direct booking available for families
   - Price range: [budget/mid/premium]
   Report findings only, do not edit files."
   ```

2. **Verification Phase** (5-point criteria check)
   - [ ] Residential camp facility (not hotels)
   - [ ] Camp operator (not travel agency)
   - [ ] Camp-only pricing (no flights included)
   - [ ] On-site programs (not tours)
   - [ ] Owns/operates facility

3. **Implementation Phase** (YOU implement)
   - Add to `src/App.jsx` allCamps array (next sequential ID)
   - Update footer country links if new country
   - Update all stat counts (see DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md Stats Checklist)
   - Test search, filtering, display

4. **Documentation Phase**
   - Update QUICK_REFERENCE.md counts
   - Update CLAUDE.md current status

### Quality Over Quantity Principles

- **Never rush**: Better to add 2 verified camps than 5 questionable ones
- **Verify everything**: Per-child pricing, working URLs, real facilities
- **Category balance**: Don't over-concentrate in one category
- **Price diversity**: Maintain options across budget/mid/premium
- **Geographic spread**: Prioritize uncovered regions over clustering

---

## Priority 5: Monetization Preparation

**Trigger:** At 1K+ sessions/month

### Revenue Stream Roadmap:
| Stream | Effort | Potential | Order |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Premium Camp Listings | Low | €4-25K/year | First |
| Affiliate Commissions | Medium | €5-15K/month | Second |
| Data Licensing | Medium | €10-30K/month | Third |
| Lead Generation | High | €20-50K/month | Fourth |

### Preparation Actions:
1. Design premium listing badge/UI
2. Research affiliate programs (camp booking platforms)
3. Document data structure for potential API
4. Add "Featured Camp" field to data structure

---

## Priority 6: Phase 2 Architecture

**Trigger:** At 1K+ sessions/month

### React Router + SSG Implementation:
- Individual camp pages with unique URLs
- Country landing pages (`/camps-in-switzerland`)
- Category pages (`/premium-alpine-camps`)
- 40+ indexable URLs vs current 1

### Technical Approach:
- Hybrid: Keep hash navigation, add real routes
- Consider Vite SSG or Next.js migration
- Detailed plan: `PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

---

## Priority 7: Multilingual SEO

**Status:** Deferred - revisit when traffic justifies investment

### Requirements for Safe Implementation:
- Add multilingual welcome section on page first
- Then add corresponding meta keywords
- Languages: Danish, German, French, Swedish, Norwegian, Spanish

### Risk Note:
Adding keywords without content may hurt rankings due to user bounce behavior.
