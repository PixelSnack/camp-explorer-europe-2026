## Selection Criteria Reminders

### Analytics-Driven Priorities
1. **High traffic + low coverage** = add camps in that country
2. **High engagement + few camps** = critical gap (e.g., Belgium was 100% engagement, 1 camp)
3. **Search terms we rank #6-15** = adding authoritative brands improves rankings
4. **Category search demand** = Sports (tennis, football) has "very high" search volume

### Camp Quality Standards
- Must pass 5-point verification (residential, operator, per-child pricing, on-site programs, owns facility)
- Prefer established brands (10+ years) for SEO authority signals
- Verify pricing in native language AND English
- Day camps acceptable only if explicitly labeled

### What NOT to Add
- No more Unique Experiences (13 = 20%, already saturated)
- No tour operators or travel agencies
- No camps with only group/facility pricing
- No camps without working booking URLs

---

## Notes for Future Sessions

- Always run verification agents before adding camps
- Always manually verify price, age range, and dates (agents fabricate data)
- Search in native language for non-English countries
- Commit in batches of 3-5 camps per session
- Update this file, MEMORY.md, and sitemap.xml after each batch
