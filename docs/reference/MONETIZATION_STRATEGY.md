## 🎉 **FIRST MONETIZATION OPPORTUNITY (January 2026)**

### **Milestone: First Inbound Camp Inquiry**

On January 16, 2026, we received our first organic inquiry from a camp operator:

**Boundless Life** (boundless.life)
- **Contact:** Megan Miller (megan.miller@boundless.life)
- **Request:** Add to our listing
- **Profile:** $2M seed-funded startup, 8 global locations, VC-backed (Sequoia/Lightspeed scout checks)
- **European Locations:** Portugal, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, Spain
- **Fit:** Family Programs category (family co-living with structured education)

### **Strategic Decision: Test Monetization Early**

Despite not reaching our 1K sessions/month threshold (currently ~168/month), we decided to test monetization because:
1. **Inbound demand validates business model** - Camps want to be listed
2. **Zero downside** - If they decline paid, we list them free anyway
3. **Market research opportunity** - Learn what camps will pay for
4. **They can afford it** - Well-funded startup, €99 is pocket change for them
