- Synthesized all findings into CODE_REVIEW_2026.md
- Archived CODE_REVIEW_PLAN.md to docs/archive/ (no longer needed — use CODE_REVIEW_2026.md directly)

- **TODO**: Extract shared `<FilterBar />` component to deduplicate
- See `docs/strategy/FILTER_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for original plan (marked complete)

---

### **🌍 1. CONTENT EXPANSION** - Target: 100+ Organizations
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Currently 65, milestone 60 PASSED, target 70 next

### **✅ 4. DURATION CONSISTENCY - Add to All Camps** ⏱️
**Status:** COMPLETED (January 26, 2026)
**Business Impact:** Professional appearance, consistent user experience

#### **Completed:**

| 5K-10K | Consider premium camp listings |
| 10K+ | Full monetization strategy |

---

## 🌍 **FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS (Backlog)**

### **Multilingual SEO Expansion** (Potential Future Priority)
**Status:** DEFERRED - Noted for future consideration
**Rationale:** Site ranks well for English terms but not local language searches (e.g., Danish "sommerlejr europa")

**Requirements for Safe Implementation:**
- Add multilingual welcome section on page (Danish, German, French, Swedish, Norwegian, Spanish)
- Only then add corresponding multilingual meta keywords
- Without actual content, adding foreign keywords risks poor user experience and organic ranking decline
- Not a penalty risk, but user bounce behavior could hurt rankings

**Languages to Consider:**
- Danish: sommerlejr, ferielejr
- German: Sommercamp, Ferienlager
- French: colonie de vacances, camp d'été
- Swedish: sommarläger, kollo
- Norwegian: sommerleir
- Spanish: campamento de verano

**Decision:** Focus on English-speaking international market for now. Revisit when traffic justifies investment.

### **Comprehensive Code Review** (ACTIVE — Tier 3 in progress)
**Status:** Tier 1+2 COMPLETE, Tier 3 partially done (8 of ~20), ~65 total items
**Document:** `CODE_REVIEW_2026.md` (CODE_REVIEW_PLAN.md archived — no longer needed)
**Business Impact:** Sale-readiness, maintainability, professional credibility

#### **Summary (updated February 3, 2026):**
- **5-agent fresh audit completed**: enterprise (doc+code), SEO (doc+code), security (code)
- **All agents READ-ONLY**: Bash/Edit/Write permanently removed via `/agents` UI
- **Output**: `CODE_REVIEW_2026.md` with ~65 items in 4 risk tiers + DO NOT TOUCH list
- **New critical findings**: Legal privacy issue, Vite EOL with CVEs, Organization schema gaps
- **Archived**: CODE_REVIEW_PLAN.md → docs/archive/ (backup also created)

### **Mobile Scroll Navigation** (UX Enhancement)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (January 28, 2026)
**Business Impact:** Better mobile experience (70% of traffic is mobile)
**Solution:** Context-aware toggle button — arrow direction follows scroll direction, down press jumps to last camp card, up press scrolls to top. Enterprise reviewed, tested iOS + PC.

### **Filter UI Refactor** (Nice to Have)
**Status:** DEFERRED - Low priority tech debt
**Business Impact:** Low - only matters when changing filter UI, which is infrequent

Filter dropdowns + chips are duplicated between Home (~line 2087) and Discover (~line 2616) sections. Both share the same state/logic — only the ~90 lines of JSX rendering are copy-pasted. Adding camps or changing filter logic does NOT require touching both places. Only a filter UI redesign would. Revisit if/when filter UI changes are needed.

### **Strengthen Camp Reputation Verification** (Low Priority)
**Status:** BACKLOG - Enhancement for quality assurance
**Business Impact:** Trust, credibility, user safety

#### **Current Coverage:**
- ✅ Established track record (2+ years preferred)
- ✅ Professional website presence
- ✅ Reviews/testimonials mentioned
- ✅ Accreditation/legitimacy checks
- ✅ Photo/video evidence of real facilities

#### **Potential Enhancements:**
- [ ] Add explicit requirement to check third-party review scores (Google Reviews, Trustpilot)
- [ ] Require searching for complaints or negative press before inclusion
- [ ] Verify specific certifications (government youth camp licenses where applicable)
- [ ] Document minimum acceptable review score threshold
- [ ] Add reputation red flags checklist to agent instructions

#### **Implementation:**
Update `.claude/agents/camp-content-researcher.md` and `.claude/agents/camp-data-verifier.md` with more explicit reputation verification criteria.
